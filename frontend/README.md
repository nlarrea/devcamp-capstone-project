# Blog Voyage - DevCamp Capstone Project

[Blog Voyage](https://nlarrea.github.io/blog-voyage) is a blog website where you can let your **imagination run wild** by reading and writing about anything you want. It is a place where you can **share your experiences and stories** with the world. You can also **read about other people's** experiences and stories!

This is the frontend repository for the **blog website**. This project is the **final project for the DevCamp program**, a 10 month full-stack course. The project is built using **React as the frontend** framework and **Python with FastAPI as the backend**, and a **MongoDB database** is used to store the data.


## What can you do in the website?

As I said before, this is a blog page. Here, the users can:

* **Read** the posts that other users have written.
* **Write** their own posts.
* **Edit** their own posts.
* **Delete** their own posts.

Users don't have to be logged in to read the posts, but they do have to be logged in to write, edit or delete their own posts.

The blogs are **sorted by date**, so the newest posts will be at the top of the page. The posts are also **limited**, so only 10 posts will be shown at the beginning. If the user wants to see more posts, they can scroll down, and the next 10 posts will be loaded.

The website is **responsive**, so it can be used on any device, from a computer to a smartphone.


## Contributing

As I said, this is a final project for the DevCamp program. If you want to contribute to the project, you can fork the repository and make your own changes. If you want to make a pull request, you can do so, but **I will not be accepting any pull requests before the end of the program** (*on November 10th, 2023*).
