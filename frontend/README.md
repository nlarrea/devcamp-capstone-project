# Blog Voyage

[Blog Voyage](https://nlarrea.github.io/blog-voyage) is a blog website where you can let your **imagination run wild** by reading and writing about anything you want. It is a place where you can **share your experiences and stories** with the world. You can also **read about other people's** experiences and stories!

This is the frontend repository for the blog website. This project is the final project for the DevCamp program, a 10 month full-stack course. The project is built using React as the frontend framework and Python as the backend framework, and a MongoDB database is used to store the data.


## Contributing

As I said, this is a final project for the DevCamp program. If you want to contribute to the project, you can fork the repository and make your own changes. If you want to make a pull request, you can do so, but **I will not be accepting any pull requests before the end of the program** (*on November 10th, 2023*).
